# Predicting-Heart-Disease-with-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model for predicting heart disease based on medical attributes using Python-based libraries. The notebook provided explores different machine learning and data science techniques to accomplish this task.


Approach
Problem Definition: Define the problem statement, which is predicting whether an individual has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Data: Discuss the dataset used for training and testing the model. Explain the features included in the dataset and their significance in predicting heart disease.

Evaluation: Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the machine learning model. Describe how accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

Features: Provide an overview of the features selected for training the model. Discuss any preprocessing steps applied to the data, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, or encoding categorical variables.

Modeling: Detail the machine learning algorithms explored for building the predictive model. Discuss the rationale behind selecting specific algorithms and any hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize model performance.

Experimentation: Describe the iterative process of experimentation, including any challenges encountered, insights gained, and improvements made to the model. Discuss the final performance metrics achieved and potential areas for future enhancements.
